In the development of the web forum, I have chosen to employ a robust
technology stack, leveraging React and Typescript for the frontend and Ruby on Rails
for the backend. The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns, with the
frontend and backend hosted on different ports. Seamless integration between the two
is achieved through the implementation of RESTful APIs, as outlined in the project
specifications. Data persistence is managed using SQLite3, providing a reliable and
lightweight solution for storing user and thread-related information.
A key component of the system is the implementation of a straightforward yet
effective authentication system. To access the features of the web forum, users are
required to log in using their unique username and password. Additionally, during the
signup process, users are prompted to provide a distinctive username, a unique
matriculation number, and a secure password. This ensures a personalized and secure
experience for each user interacting with the platform.
Upon successful login or signup, users are initially directed to a homepage,
serving as a gateway to the forum's diverse functionalities. Only after this initial
authentication step are users granted access to the discussion thread page. Here, an
array of threads is meticulously listed, providing users with the opportunity to explore
and engage in discussions. Commenting functionality is seamlessly integrated,
allowing users to contribute their thoughts and insights to the ongoing conversations.
The user interface is enhanced with a navigation bar that becomes available
after users log in. This feature-rich navigation bar facilitates easy navigation and
interaction with the forum. Users can conveniently log out or initiate the creation of a
new thread by clicking on the respective tabs. The implementation of CRUD (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) operations is particularly noteworthy on the create thread page,
offering users a seamless experience in managing and organizing discussions. Users
will need to provide title, content and tag during the creation of a new thread.
Furthermore, an aesthetically pleasing design is complemented by a category
feature, providing users with the ability to explore threads grouped by specific tags.
This categorization enhances the overall user experience, making it easier for
individuals to locate discussions that align with their interests.
In summary, the web forum seamlessly combines frontend technologies such
as React and Typescript with the robust backend capabilities of Ruby on Rails. The
user experience is enriched by a well-thought-out authentication system, an intuitive
navigation bar, and features like thread categorization. The forum aims to provide a
comprehensive and engaging platform for users to connect, discuss, and share their
insights.
